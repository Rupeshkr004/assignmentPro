This Terraform configuration provisions the necessary Azure infrastructure components to support the deployment of a sample application that prints "Welcome to 2022" along with user agent info on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

## Overview

This Terraform setup creates the following Azure resources:

- Resource Group: Provides a logical container for grouping Azure resources.
- Virtual Network (VNet) and Subnet: Defines the networking infrastructure for the AKS cluster.
- Storage Account and Container: Stores the `terraform.tfstate` files for state management.

## Prerequisites

Before running this Terraform configuration, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) installed on your local machine.
- An Azure account with appropriate permissions to create and manage resources.
- Azure CLI installed for authentication and interaction with Azure services.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/welcome-to-2022.git
    cd welcome-to-2022/terraform
    ```

2. Initialize Terraform:

    ```bash
    terraform init
    ```

3. Review and modify the `main.tf` and `variables.tf` files as needed to customize the Terraform configuration according to your requirements.

4. Authenticate with Azure using the Azure CLI:

    ```bash
    az login
    ```

5. Run Terraform plan to preview the changes:

    ```bash
    terraform plan
    ```

6. If the plan looks correct, apply the Terraform configuration to provision the Azure infrastructure:

    ```bash
    terraform apply
    ```

7. Review the Terraform output for any errors or warnings. Once completed, the Azure resources should be provisioned successfully.

## Cleanup

To clean up and delete the Azure resources created by this Terraform configuration, run:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

Confirm the destruction when prompted.
